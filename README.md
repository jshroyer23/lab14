The focus group results have been collected and the BusMall catalog is ready to be released! The results were so positive that the marketing team would also like to make these products available for online purchase. Your task is to bring functionality to an order form page and a shopping cart page.

The marketing team wants the site deployed for testing in a few hours. To give you an idea of what they are looking for, the team has added some TODO tasks throughout the JavaScript files. They do not have any preferences for styling, so use your best judgment when filling in the style.css file. However, they refuse to budge on the structure of the website and have asked that you DO NOT modify the HTML files in any way.

Your senior dev was able to meet with you and your teammate for few minutes to get you oriented to the code base. She was able to give you the following pointers, before getting pulled into a code review for another feature.

There are multiple .js files
cart.js is used on the cart page and catalog.js is used on the page with the form
The app.js file carries some global variables that the others will reference, and is loaded into both pages
You will encounter and need to deal with a new type of form element
You will need to reference elements without IDs
